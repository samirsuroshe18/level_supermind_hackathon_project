1\. Understand the Format and Rules

- Familiarize yourself with the specific rules for the sport (cricket, football, etc.) and the format of the contest (head-to-head, leagues, etc.).

2\. Research Players

- Form: Look at players’ recent performances and consistency.
- Injuries: Check for any injuries or fitness issues that might affect player participation.
- Match Conditions: Consider how players perform in specific conditions (pitch type, weather, etc.).

3\. Balance Your Team

- Player Roles: Include a mix of batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicket-keepers (for cricket). In football, balance between defenders, midfielders, forwards, and a goalkeeper.
- Budget Management: Dream11 has a budget constraint, so choose a combination of star players and budget picks who can perform well.

4\. Captain and Vice-Captain Selection

- Choose a captain (2x points) and a vice-captain (1.5x points) wisely. Typically, pick players who are in form and likely to perform well.

5\. Stay Updated

- Follow expert analyses, team news, and last-minute updates before the match starts, as they can significantly influence player performance.

6\. Analyze Head-to-Head Statistics

- Look at how players perform against specific teams or in particular venues.

7\. Join Multiple Contests

- Enter various contests with different team combinations to maximize your chances of winning.

8\. Review and Learn

- After each match, review your team's performance to learn what worked and what didn’t, which can help improve your strategy for future contests.

Example Team Selection (for Cricket)

1. Wicketkeeper: 1-2 players
2. Batsmen: 3-5 players
3. All-rounders: 1-3 players
4. Bowlers: 3-5 players

Conclusion

Building a good Dream11 team requires ongoing learning and adaptation. Stay engaged with the sport, analyze performances, and adjust your strategies based on what you learn. Good luck!

A WINNING DREAM 11

In dream 11 you have to choose a single mixed team from both team of 11 players(1 keeper,3–5 batsmen,3–5 Bowler)and also make two very important decisions- captain and vice captain.The better the player performs more the points you gain.

A captain makes twice(2 X) the points earned.

A vice captain makes (1.5 times) the points earned

A batsman makes 1 points on every 2 runs scored.

A bowler makes 10 points on every wicket taken.

A fielder gets 4 points on every catch.

A keeper get 6 points on stumping.

Special bonus points are also there on greater strike rates, boundaries,half century or century for a batsmen.

Similarly bonus points are on better economic rates,maidens for a bowler,run outs etc etc.

Here SHANE WATSON was chosen as captain before the match.Eventually was the best performer of the match.He scored a century and also took one wicket .His points doubled at a rate faster than any other player.Made a huge escalation here by getting 171 points here just from one player Watson

DWYANE BRAVO was chosen as vice captain before the match.He scored quick 24 runs and 2 wickets.He was 2nd best player after Watson.

The winner of this contest precisely predicted the two best performers of the match as captain and vice captain.He predicted these two players only because if you see the previous matches,Shane Watson and Dwayne Bravo were in good form has performed well in the recent matches.Bravo was Man of the match in first match of IPL 2018.Both are all-rounders so you earn both ways -wickets and runs.

HOW TO CHOOSE THE CAPTAIN AND VICE CAPTAIN(MOST CRUCIAL)

1.First of all make sure the player you choose plays on the match day. This information is available at cricbuzz 5 hours before the match begins.

2.The player must be 100% fit and most importantly in good form.A bad form batsmen can also play dramatically well but the chances are very less.

3.The player can be a established and very famous player,has a reputation of scoring big in the recent past like GAYLE,KOHLI,RUSSELL. These players are mostly a good bet.They are prolific hitters known to play a big innings.

4.A fine Indian player who is young and not having any international exposure but has tremendous record in domestic circuit usually unnoticed by audience can be a big player in that day.Examples like SAMSON.NITISH RANA in this IPL have proved to be match winners.They know local conditions better than anyone having played a lot in India.

5.If you are choosing a bowler as a captain.That bowler has to take multiple wickets with good economic rate,which is hard to predict as in many occasions good bowlers go expensive in a T-20 game.Bowlers as a captain can be a good decision when its a low scoring game.Mostly bowler is not chosen as a Captain by majority because of uncertainty.

6\. All-rounders like NARINE,BEN STOKES,WATSON are favourites because they make you gain on both innings with bat and ball.They are worth Two players in a single selection.

7.Choosing captain among 5 best players out of 11 can be tricky like in this match other than WATSON and BRAVO favourites were also RAINA,RAHANE,SAMSON,RAYUDU but they all flopped except RAINA who made decent 46 .

In order to mitigate this risk of wrong captain and vice captain you can go with 4 different combinations.

In worst case 2 combinations will fetch you benefit and other 2 combination will get you loss.But if the benefit earns you heavy amount then it will cover up your losses.

He chose Watson as captain.Remember this is most important decision because captains get twice the points made by him and a similarly Vice captain 1.5 times.

KNOW THE EXACT PLAYING 22

You have to know first which 22 players(11 each for both teams) are going to play on the day.The actual squad is around 40 players(20 each for both teams).Many players are made to sit on bench.Never choose a player from squad who is in bench.Reason of not in playing 11 are many like not in form,unfit,not in India,rested,banned,injured,personal reasons.

If you choose a rested player you get zero points for that player,so don’t go with players who are doubtful to play.

In this match this was the playing 11 for both teams .You can see half of the squad is on the bench.

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c0a31eb5e0b37ae79f432593069174d1-pjlq)

Filter out the playing 22 out of this list of 40.The information will be available at cricbuzz 5 hours before the match start time.But there can be few last minute changes in the team which is informed during the toss and then you can’t make any changes as dream 11 locks one hour before the match. So you have to rely on the news circulating in the internet before the match which are 90% accurate.

HOW TO CHOOSE OTHER 9 PLAYERS (OTHER THAN CAPTAIN AND VICE CAPTAIN)

1.You get 100 credits to select the all eleven players.Each player has some credit score.The better the player ,greater is his credit score. You have to manage your team selection such that it doesn't exceed 100 credit score.

2.You can choose at most 7 players from a single team and have to choose at least 4 from a team.A combination can be of 7:4,6:6,5:6,6:5,4:7.

3.There can be many good players to choose. So you can form multiple combination and enter a single contest with at maximum 6 different teams with different captains and Vice captain.Hoping one or two of them to win and fetch you heavy earnings to offset the loss of 25 Rs each on other failed teams.

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f0d9722fb9ee5cf4dcb0650ef54c971b)

THE PROBABILITY OF WINNING BIG

There are two kind of contests

One is Grand League (lacks of participants,more competition but less entry fees like 10,25,50 Rs ) and the other is small league( few 10/20 participants ,less competition,high entry fees like Rs 5000,10,000).

Grand League structure is

MY SUGGESTIONS

If your captain scores a duck and vice captain too performs badly.Irrespective of how other players play,you are bound to be in bottom 50 % of the population you are competing. In these cases you loose the amount you paid,end up winning nothing.There is a 50% probability of such situation taking place.

If your ranks just crosses top 50 % of the partcipants,you just recover your amount paid as an entry fees.Thus there is no profit and no loss.

In rarest cases ,when your captain and vice captains have performed brilliantly on the day and the other players excluding one or two have contributed effectively.Then you are in the top 10%,you receive double of what you paid.

Then your rank will be within 100,here you earn in Rs 100–Rs 10,000

Rank 1 does make a absolutely perfect prediction ,if you see his team ,you will feel as if he had already seen the match and has a Time machine.But its matter of luck and some intuition combined.The winner must have played a lot and lost on many previous occasions.But the more you play,greater are the chances to win.You need to be aware about every players profile.Who is good,better and best.

SOME GENERAL CRICKETING TRENDS

Remember local Indian players have more hunger to perform,because their target is to make it to Indian team.These players have a internal pressure and desire to perform.Rishabh Pant,Shreyas Iyer,Markande are not so famous yet effective contributors.See their their stats,do some research.They can be worth the risk.

Foreign players are mostly vulnerable to spin and spinners have lesser economy rate than a fast bowler.Take spinners.

Always pick westindies player.They are master of T-20 format.Gayle,Bravo,Narine,Pollard.

Legends don’t play well on every match.They score on alternate matches.Keep them in your team,you never know when they may explode.

But some are all season favourites like Virat Kohli,ABD,Bhuvi,Trent Bolt.They are consistent and committed,Never miss them.Everyone has kept them in their team.

Never think emotionally over the older players.They are famous but not worth picking .They have crossed their best days.They had a past but not future.Examples are Yuvraj,Harbhajan,Gambhir.

Take a frontline batsmen,they get more liberty and space to score.The middle and bottom order batsmen slog and get out quickly.Sometimes they dont get to bat,hence you get less points.Example-K L Rahul is effective frontliner

Out of form player are dusted and rusted.They fail miserably everytime. Dont pick them.Eventually they will not make it in the playing 11 itself.Example-Rahul Tripathi

Keep a eye on wicket taking bowler.A bowler gets you 10 points for a wicket which is equivalent to 20 runs.you can pick Sunil Narine,Umesh yadav every time.If its a bowling pitch,then you can pick more bowlers than batsmen.

Remember there can be only 4 foreign players in each side,so there is a tough fight for them to make it in the playing 11.Many times we see foreign players on account of one bad performance are made to sit in the next match.Example-Chris Morris,Darcy Short made to sit in this IPL after some flop show. So don’t pick such foreign players who are doubtful to play.

This a thumbs rule,whenever a new bowler debuts usually the opponent team doesn't have idea on the bowling style.Thus the batsmen tends to commit mistake ends up loosing wicket.For example-Jeffry Archer got 3 wickets on debut.Mayank Markhande got 5 wickets on debut.Keep an eye on debutant bowler.I suggest keep them in your team.

THATS IT FOR NOW.

Is there a secret to auto insurance that will save money?

I once met a man who drove a modest Toyota Corolla, wore beat-up sneakers, and looked like he’d lived the same way for decades. But what really caught my attention was when he casually mentioned he was retired at 45 with more money than he could ever spend. I couldn’t help but ask, “How did you do it?”

He smiled and said, “The secret to saving money is knowing where to look for the waste—and car insurance is one of the easiest places to start.”

He then walked me through a few strategies that I’d never thought of before. Here’s what I learned:

I once met a man who drove a modest Toyota Corolla, wore beat-up sneakers, and looked like he’d lived the same way for decades. But what really caught my attention was when he casually mentioned he was retired at 45 with more money than he could ever spend. I couldn’t help but ask, “How did you do it?”

He smiled and said, “The secret to saving money is knowing where to look for the waste—and car insurance is one of the easiest places to start.”

He then walked me through a few strategies that I’d never thought of before. Here’s what I learned:

1\. Make insurance companies fight for your business

Most people just stick with the same insurer year after year, but that’s what the companies are counting on. This guy used tools like [Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_J_SecretAuto_DT&qclid=1285844749598218547%7C211106241661669%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") to compare rates every time his policy came up for renewal. It only took him a few minutes, and he said he’d saved hundreds each year by letting insurers compete for his business.

[Click here to try Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_J_SecretAuto_DT&qclid=1285844749598218547%7C211106241661669%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") and see how much you could save today.

2\. Take advantage of safe driver programs

He mentioned that some companies reward good drivers with significant discounts. By signing up for a program that tracked his driving habits for just a month, he qualified for a lower rate. “It’s like a test where you already know the answers,” he joked.

You can find a [list of insurance companies offering safe driver discounts here](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_J_SecretAuto_DT&qclid=1285844749598218547%7C211106241661669%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") and start saving on your next policy.

3\. Bundle your policies

He bundled his auto insurance with his home insurance and saved big. “Most companies will give you a discount if you combine your policies with them. It’s easy money,” he explained. If you haven’t bundled yet, ask your insurer what discounts they offer—or look for new ones that do.

4\. Drop coverage you don’t need

He also emphasized reassessing coverage every year. If your car isn’t worth much anymore, it might be time to drop collision or comprehensive coverage. “You shouldn’t be paying more to insure the car than it’s worth,” he said.

5\. Look for hidden fees or overpriced add-ons

One of his final tips was to avoid extras like roadside assistance, which can often be purchased elsewhere for less. “It’s those little fees you don’t think about that add up,” he warned.

The Secret? Stop Overpaying

The real “secret” isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about being proactive. Car insurance companies are counting on you to stay complacent, but with tools like [Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_J_SecretAuto_DT&qclid=1285844749598218547%7C211106241661669%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") and a little effort, you can make sure you’re only paying for what you need—and saving hundreds in the process.

I don't know there exist a trick or not.But I have been using it from 2–3 months now and I have learned the following

1)Never join the league with more than 20 members.Don't get carried away by the winning price of the grand league you can never win it.

2)join the league which is having multiple winners(eg:60rs league which is having 20 members and 5 winners).This will ensure that even if you don't form the correct team you can reduce the loss

3)Don't hope to win every day.

4)Play regularly.Consider the 60rs league having 20 members even if you win 1/5 times you will make 200rs profit.

5)Don't part

6)Follow teams in social media to get news about any changes in the playing 11.

7)Don't look at your ranking before the end of the match . It can change at any time and you will be disheartened if you come down.

update:

8)Make atleast 3 teams.

team 1: top order of team1 play well

team 2: top order of team2 play well

team3: mixed depending on players form.
