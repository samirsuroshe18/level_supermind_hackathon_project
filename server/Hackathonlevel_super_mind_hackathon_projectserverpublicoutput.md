Creating a successful Dream11 team requires a combination of strategy, research, and an understanding of the sport you're focusing on. Here are some tips to help you build a competitive team:

1\. Understand the Format and Rules

- Familiarize yourself with the specific rules for the sport (cricket, football, etc.) and the format of the contest (head-to-head, leagues, etc.).

2\. Research Players

- Form: Look at players’ recent performances and consistency.
- Injuries: Check for any injuries or fitness issues that might affect player participation.
- Match Conditions: Consider how players perform in specific conditions (pitch type, weather, etc.).

3\. Balance Your Team

- Player Roles: Include a mix of batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicket-keepers (for cricket). In football, balance between defenders, midfielders, forwards, and a goalkeeper.
- Budget Management: Dream11 has a budget constraint, so choose a combination of star players and budget picks who can perform well.

4\. Captain and Vice-Captain Selection

- Choose a captain (2x points) and a vice-captain (1.5x points) wisely. Typically, pick players who are in form and likely to perform well.

5\. Stay Updated

- Follow expert analyses, team news, and last-minute updates before the match starts, as they can significantly influence player performance.

6\. Analyze Head-to-Head Statistics

- Look at how players perform against specific teams or in particular venues.

7\. Join Multiple Contests

- Enter various contests with different team combinations to maximize your chances of winning.

8\. Review and Learn

- After each match, review your team's performance to learn what worked and what didn’t, which can help improve your strategy for future contests.

Example Team Selection (for Cricket)

1. Wicketkeeper: 1-2 players
2. Batsmen: 3-5 players
3. All-rounders: 1-3 players
4. Bowlers: 3-5 players

Conclusion

Building a good Dream11 team requires ongoing learning and adaptation. Stay engaged with the sport, analyze performances, and adjust your strategies based on what you learn. Good luck!

A WINNING DREAM 11

In dream 11 you have to choose a single mixed team from both team of 11 players(1 keeper,3–5 batsmen,3–5 Bowler)and also make two very important decisions- captain and vice captain.The better the player performs more the points you gain.

A captain makes twice(2 X) the points earned.

A vice captain makes (1.5 times) the points earned

A batsman makes 1 points on every 2 runs scored.

A bowler makes 10 points on every wicket taken.

A fielder gets 4 points on every catch.

A keeper get 6 points on stumping.

Special bonus points are also there on greater strike rates, boundaries,half century or century for a batsmen.

Similarly bonus points are on better economic rates,maidens for a bowler,run outs etc etc.

Here SHANE WATSON was chosen as captain before the match.Eventually was the best performer of the match.He scored a century and also took one wicket .His points doubled at a rate faster than any other player.Made a huge escalation here by getting 171 points here just from one player Watson

DWYANE BRAVO was chosen as vice captain before the match.He scored quick 24 runs and 2 wickets.He was 2nd best player after Watson.

The winner of this contest precisely predicted the two best performers of the match as captain and vice captain.He predicted these two players only because if you see the previous matches,Shane Watson and Dwayne Bravo were in good form has performed well in the recent matches.Bravo was Man of the match in first match of IPL 2018.Both are all-rounders so you earn both ways -wickets and runs.

HOW TO CHOOSE THE CAPTAIN AND VICE CAPTAIN(MOST CRUCIAL)

1.First of all make sure the player you choose plays on the match day. This information is available at cricbuzz 5 hours before the match begins.

2.The player must be 100% fit and most importantly in good form.A bad form batsmen can also play dramatically well but the chances are very less.

3.The player can be a established and very famous player,has a reputation of scoring big in the recent past like GAYLE,KOHLI,RUSSELL. These players are mostly a good bet.They are prolific hitters known to play a big innings.

4.A fine Indian player who is young and not having any international exposure but has tremendous record in domestic circuit usually unnoticed by audience can be a big player in that day.Examples like SAMSON.NITISH RANA in this IPL have proved to be match winners.They know local conditions better than anyone having played a lot in India.

5.If you are choosing a bowler as a captain.That bowler has to take multiple wickets with good economic rate,which is hard to predict as in many occasions good bowlers go expensive in a T-20 game.Bowlers as a captain can be a good decision when its a low scoring game.Mostly bowler is not chosen as a Captain by majority because of uncertainty.

6\. All-rounders like NARINE,BEN STOKES,WATSON are favourites because they make you gain on both innings with bat and ball.They are worth Two players in a single selection.

7.Choosing captain among 5 best players out of 11 can be tricky like in this match other than WATSON and BRAVO favourites were also RAINA,RAHANE,SAMSON,RAYUDU but they all flopped except RAINA who made decent 46 .

In order to mitigate this risk of wrong captain and vice captain you can go with 4 different combinations.

In worst case 2 combinations will fetch you benefit and other 2 combination will get you loss.But if the benefit earns you heavy amount then it will cover up your losses.

He chose Watson as captain.Remember this is most important decision because captains get twice the points made by him and a similarly Vice captain 1.5 times.

KNOW THE EXACT PLAYING 22

You have to know first which 22 players(11 each for both teams) are going to play on the day.The actual squad is around 40 players(20 each for both teams).Many players are made to sit on bench.Never choose a player from squad who is in bench.Reason of not in playing 11 are many like not in form,unfit,not in India,rested,banned,injured,personal reasons.

If you choose a rested player you get zero points for that player,so don’t go with players who are doubtful to play.

In this match this was the playing 11 for both teams .You can see half of the squad is on the bench.

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c0a31eb5e0b37ae79f432593069174d1-pjlq)

Filter out the playing 22 out of this list of 40.The information will be available at cricbuzz 5 hours before the match start time.But there can be few last minute changes in the team which is informed during the toss and then you can’t make any changes as dream 11 locks one hour before the match. So you have to rely on the news circulating in the internet before the match which are 90% accurate.

HOW TO CHOOSE OTHER 9 PLAYERS (OTHER THAN CAPTAIN AND VICE CAPTAIN)

1.You get 100 credits to select the all eleven players.Each player has some credit score.The better the player ,greater is his credit score. You have to manage your team selection such that it doesn't exceed 100 credit score.

2.You can choose at most 7 players from a single team and have to choose at least 4 from a team.A combination can be of 7:4,6:6,5:6,6:5,4:7.

3.There can be many good players to choose. So you can form multiple combination and enter a single contest with at maximum 6 different teams with different captains and Vice captain.Hoping one or two of them to win and fetch you heavy earnings to offset the loss of 25 Rs each on other failed teams.

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f0d9722fb9ee5cf4dcb0650ef54c971b)

THE PROBABILITY OF WINNING BIG

There are two kind of contests

One is Grand League (lacks of participants,more competition but less entry fees like 10,25,50 Rs ) and the other is small league( few 10/20 participants ,less competition,high entry fees like Rs 5000,10,000).

Grand League structure is

MY SUGGESTIONS

If your captain scores a duck and vice captain too performs badly.Irrespective of how other players play,you are bound to be in bottom 50 % of the population you are competing. In these cases you loose the amount you paid,end up winning nothing.There is a 50% probability of such situation taking place.

If your ranks just crosses top 50 % of the partcipants,you just recover your amount paid as an entry fees.Thus there is no profit and no loss.

In rarest cases ,when your captain and vice captains have performed brilliantly on the day and the other players excluding one or two have contributed effectively.Then you are in the top 10%,you receive double of what you paid.

Then your rank will be within 100,here you earn in Rs 100–Rs 10,000

Rank 1 does make a absolutely perfect prediction ,if you see his team ,you will feel as if he had already seen the match and has a Time machine.But its matter of luck and some intuition combined.The winner must have played a lot and lost on many previous occasions.But the more you play,greater are the chances to win.You need to be aware about every players profile.Who is good,better and best.

SOME GENERAL CRICKETING TRENDS

Remember local Indian players have more hunger to perform,because their target is to make it to Indian team.These players have a internal pressure and desire to perform.Rishabh Pant,Shreyas Iyer,Markande are not so famous yet effective contributors.See their their stats,do some research.They can be worth the risk.

Foreign players are mostly vulnerable to spin and spinners have lesser economy rate than a fast bowler.Take spinners.

Always pick westindies player.They are master of T-20 format.Gayle,Bravo,Narine,Pollard.

Legends don’t play well on every match.They score on alternate matches.Keep them in your team,you never know when they may explode.

But some are all season favourites like Virat Kohli,ABD,Bhuvi,Trent Bolt.They are consistent and committed,Never miss them.Everyone has kept them in their team.

Never think emotionally over the older players.They are famous but not worth picking .They have crossed their best days.They had a past but not future.Examples are Yuvraj,Harbhajan,Gambhir.

Take a frontline batsmen,they get more liberty and space to score.The middle and bottom order batsmen slog and get out quickly.Sometimes they dont get to bat,hence you get less points.Example-K L Rahul is effective frontliner

Out of form player are dusted and rusted.They fail miserably everytime. Dont pick them.Eventually they will not make it in the playing 11 itself.Example-Rahul Tripathi

Keep a eye on wicket taking bowler.A bowler gets you 10 points for a wicket which is equivalent to 20 runs.you can pick Sunil Narine,Umesh yadav every time.If its a bowling pitch,then you can pick more bowlers than batsmen.

Remember there can be only 4 foreign players in each side,so there is a tough fight for them to make it in the playing 11.Many times we see foreign players on account of one bad performance are made to sit in the next match.Example-Chris Morris,Darcy Short made to sit in this IPL after some flop show. So don’t pick such foreign players who are doubtful to play.

This a thumbs rule,whenever a new bowler debuts usually the opponent team doesn't have idea on the bowling style.Thus the batsmen tends to commit mistake ends up loosing wicket.For example-Jeffry Archer got 3 wickets on debut.Mayank Markhande got 5 wickets on debut.Keep an eye on debutant bowler.I suggest keep them in your team.

THATS IT FOR NOW.

Is there a secret to auto insurance that will save money?

I once met a man who drove a modest Toyota Corolla, wore beat-up sneakers, and looked like he’d lived the same way for decades. But what really caught my attention was when he casually mentioned he was retired at 45 with more money than he could ever spend. I couldn’t help but ask, “How did you do it?”

He smiled and said, “The secret to saving money is knowing where to look for the waste—and car insurance is one of the easiest places to start.”

He then walked me through a few strategies that I’d never thought of before. Here’s what I learned:

I once met a man who drove a modest Toyota Corolla, wore beat-up sneakers, and looked like he’d lived the same way for decades. But what really caught my attention was when he casually mentioned he was retired at 45 with more money than he could ever spend. I couldn’t help but ask, “How did you do it?”

He smiled and said, “The secret to saving money is knowing where to look for the waste—and car insurance is one of the easiest places to start.”

He then walked me through a few strategies that I’d never thought of before. Here’s what I learned:

1\. Make insurance companies fight for your business

Most people just stick with the same insurer year after year, but that’s what the companies are counting on. This guy used tools like [Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_J_SecretAuto_DT&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241661669%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") to compare rates every time his policy came up for renewal. It only took him a few minutes, and he said he’d saved hundreds each year by letting insurers compete for his business.

[Click here to try Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_J_SecretAuto_DT&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241661669%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") and see how much you could save today.

2\. Take advantage of safe driver programs

He mentioned that some companies reward good drivers with significant discounts. By signing up for a program that tracked his driving habits for just a month, he qualified for a lower rate. “It’s like a test where you already know the answers,” he joked.

You can find a [list of insurance companies offering safe driver discounts here](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_J_SecretAuto_DT&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241661669%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") and start saving on your next policy.

3\. Bundle your policies

He bundled his auto insurance with his home insurance and saved big. “Most companies will give you a discount if you combine your policies with them. It’s easy money,” he explained. If you haven’t bundled yet, ask your insurer what discounts they offer—or look for new ones that do.

4\. Drop coverage you don’t need

He also emphasized reassessing coverage every year. If your car isn’t worth much anymore, it might be time to drop collision or comprehensive coverage. “You shouldn’t be paying more to insure the car than it’s worth,” he said.

5\. Look for hidden fees or overpriced add-ons

One of his final tips was to avoid extras like roadside assistance, which can often be purchased elsewhere for less. “It’s those little fees you don’t think about that add up,” he warned.

The Secret? Stop Overpaying

The real “secret” isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about being proactive. Car insurance companies are counting on you to stay complacent, but with tools like [Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_J_SecretAuto_DT&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241661669%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") and a little effort, you can make sure you’re only paying for what you need—and saving hundreds in the process.

I don't know there exist a trick or not.But I have been using it from 2–3 months now and I have learned the following

1)Never join the league with more than 20 members.Don't get carried away by the winning price of the grand league you can never win it.

2)join the league which is having multiple winners(eg:60rs league which is having 20 members and 5 winners).This will ensure that even if you don't form the correct team you can reduce the loss

3)Don't hope to win every day.

4)Play regularly.Consider the 60rs league having 20 members even if you win 1/5 times you will make 200rs profit.

5)Don't part

6)Follow teams in social media to get news about any changes in the playing 11.

7)Don't look at your ranking before the end of the match . It can change at any time and you will be disheartened if you come down.

update:

8)Make atleast 3 teams.

team 1: top order of team1 play well

team 2: top order of team2 play well

team3: mixed depending on players form.

3. Select players: Select players who you think will perform well in the actual match. Keep track of their recent performances, injuries, and the conditions of the ground where the match will be played. Make sure to select a balanced team with a mix of batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders.
4. Choose a captain and vice-captain: Choose a captain and vice-captain for your team. The captain gets 2x points, while the vice-captain gets 1.5x points. So, choose your captain and vice-captain wisely.
5. Save your team: After selecting your team and captain/vice-captain, save your team. You can make changes to your team until the deadline before the match starts.
6. Join contests: Join contests to compete with other users. You can choose to join free or paid contests, depending on your preference.

Remember, creating a dream team requires a good understanding of the sport and the players. So, do your research, analyze the statistics, and choose your players wisely.

For more profit, you can use other apps like dream11 because the alternative to the dream11 app has low competition.

Thank you.

What are the stupidest money mistakes most people make?

Where do I start?

I’m a huge financial nerd, and have spent an embarrassing amount of time talking to people about their money habits.

Here are the biggest mistakes people are making and how to fix them:

Not having a separate high interest savings account

Having a separate account allows you to see the results of all your hard work and keep your money separate so you're less tempted to spend it.

Plus with rates above 5.00%, the interest you can earn compared to most banks really adds up.

Overpaying on car insurance

You’ve heard it a million times before, but the average American family still overspends by $417/year on car insurance.

If you’ve been with the same insurer for years, chances are you are one of them.

Pull up [Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_Mult_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.myfinance.com"), a free site that will compare prices for you, answer the questions on the page, and it will show you how much you could be saving.

That’s it. You’ll likely be saving a bunch of money. [Here’s a link to give it a try](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_Mult_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.myfinance.com").

Consistently being in debt

If you’ve got $10K+ in debt (credit cards…medical bills…anything really) you could use a [debt relief program](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/best-debt-relief-options/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.bankrate.com") and potentially reduce by over 20%.

Here’s how to see if you qualify:

Head over to this Debt Relief comparison website [here](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/best-debt-relief-options/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.bankrate.com"), then simply answer the questions to see if you qualify.

It’s as simple as that. You’ll likely end up paying less than you owed before and you could be debt free in as little as 2 years.

Missing out on free money to invest

It’s no secret that millionaires love investing, but for the rest of us, it can seem out of reach.

Times have changed. There are a number of [investing platforms](https://savingspro.org/the-best-ways-for-to-invest/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "savingspro.org") that will give you a bonus to open an account and get started. All you have to do is open the account and invest at least $25, and you could get up to $1000 in bonus.

Pretty sweet deal right? Here is a [link](https://savingspro.org/the-best-ways-for-to-invest/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "savingspro.org") to some of the best options.

Having bad credit

A low credit score can come back to bite you in so many ways in the future.

From that next rental application to getting approved for any type of loan or credit card, if you have a bad history with credit, the good news is you can fix it.

Head over to [BankRate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/credit-repair/?sub-id=Q_Multi_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.bankrate.com") and answer a few questions to see if you qualify. It only takes a few minutes and could save you from a major upset down the line.

How to get started

Hope this helps! Here are the links to get started:

[Have a separate savings account](https://savingspro.org/savings-rates/?sub-id=Q_Sav_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "savingspro.org")

[Stop overpaying for car insurance](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_Mult_DT1&s2=%7BCLICK_ID%7D&qclid=1846803751707269057%7C211106241156263%7C0 "www.myfinance.com")

If I knew, I would have stood along with Ambani and had my own franchisee in IPL. Mysuru Maharajas I guess

Jokes apart, it's not easy.

1. Choosing proper Capt n VC. Many times, this will return our investments.
2. Play smaller leagues to understand what's going on. Smaller leagues shud help to invest in bigger leagues.
3. I guess, we need to think like Managers, Dhoni, leaders + wait for luck to favor.
4. If it's not your day, it's not. Have patience. Know, when to stop. Limit investment to some amount (per day, per month), DONT GAMBLE, PLAY n ENJOY.

Putting all these secrets to use is actually easier than you might think. We’re betting you can knock out at least three or four of these things right now — yes, even from your phone.

Go ahead and get in on these money secrets

1\. Cancel Your Car Insurance

You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix.

Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=319&aff_id=114&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [Insurify](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=319&aff_id=114&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year.

If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you.

Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=319&aff_id=114&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [see how much you could save on car insurance](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_ad?campaign_id=319&aff_id=114&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com").

2\. You Can Become a Real Estate Investor for as Little as $10

Take a look at some of the world’s wealthiest people. What do they have in common? Many invest in large private real estate deals. And here’s the thing: There’s no reason you can’t, too — for as little as $10.

[An investment called the Fundrise Flagship Fund](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7384&aff_id=2&aff_id=114&source=smarten-up-americans-prt&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") lets you get started in the world of real estate by giving you access to a low-cost, diversified portfolio of private real estate. The best part? You don’t have to be the landlord. The Flagship Fund does all the heavy lifting.

With an initial investment as low as $10, your money will be invested in the Fund, which already owns more than $1 billion worth of real estate around the country, from apartment complexes to the thriving housing rental market to larger last-mile e-commerce logistics centers.

Want to invest more? Many investors choose to invest $1,000 or more. This is a Fund that can fit any type of investor’s needs. Once invested, you can track your performance from your phone and watch as properties are acquired, improved, and operated. As properties generate cash flow, you could earn money through quarterly dividend payments. And over time, you could earn money off the potential appreciation of the properties.

So if you want to get started in the world of real-estate investing, it takes just a few minutes to [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7384&aff_id=2&aff_id=114&source=smarten-up-americans-prt&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [sign up and create an account with the Fundrise Flagship Fund](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=7384&aff_id=2&aff_id=114&source=smarten-up-americans-prt&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com").

This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Real Estate Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the [Fund’s prospectus](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fundrise-content/website-documents/d8746297-3e7a-47c3-a6eb-df46fb4c8d64/Fundrise%20Income%20Real%20Estate%20Fund%20Prospectus.pdf "s3.amazonaws.com"). Read them carefully before investing.

3\. Stop Paying Your Credit Card Company

If you have credit card debt, you know. The anxiety, the interest rates, the fear you’re never going to escape…

And the truth is, your credit card company doesn’t really care. It’s just getting rich by ripping you off with high interest rates — some up to 36%. But a website called [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6370&aff_id=114&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [AmOne](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6370&aff_id=114&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") wants to help.

If you owe your credit card companies $100,000 or less, AmOne will match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every single one of your balances.

The benefit? You’ll be left with one bill to pay each month. And because personal loans have lower interest rates (AmOne rates start at 6.40% APR), you’ll get out of debt that much faster. Plus: No credit card payment this month.

You don’t need a perfect credit score to get a loan — and comparing your options won’t affect your score at all. Plus, AmOne keeps your information confidential and secure, which is probably why after 20 years in business, it still has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.

It takes less than a minute and just 10 questions to [t.thepennyhoarder.com](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6370&aff_id=114&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com") [see what loans you qualify for](https://t.thepennyhoarder.com/aff_c?offer_id=6370&aff_id=114&source=money-secrets-prt-quora&aff_sub3=money-secrets-promoted-answer&aff_sub4=%7B%7Bcampaign.id%7D%7D "t.thepennyhoarder.com")— you don’t even need to enter your Social Security number. You do need to give AmOne a real phone number in order to qualify, but don’t worry — they won’t spam you with phone calls.

4\. Earn as Much as $1K/Month Doing Simple Online Tasks

Today I will tell you how to make dream 11 best team and how to win in dream 11 . So, let’s get started.

#1Choose your favourite category.

Dream11 provides you with a lot of sports categories such as Cricket, Football, Baseball, Basketball, Kabaddi, Handball and many more. Select a category where you have sufficient knowledge or you have an interest.

#2Select a match.

Select any upcoming Dream 11 match from your favourable category.

Select your favourite players and create your own dream team on Dream11. You can select up to 11 players with a maximum of 100 credits including Wicket keeper, Batsmen, All Rounders and Bowlers. However, you can check every player's stats or his recent info by clicking their photo. Moreover, you can see the player points that he achieved in recent matches. And this is the place where you are convinced to win from your knowledge.

#4Join a Contest.

Join a contest as much you can afford. It could be free or it could be paid. It depends on your choice as you want. One of the best things about this game is that it provides you with a lot of contest categories, such as Mega contests, Hot Contests, Beginner Contests, Head to Head Contests, Low entry contests, Contest for champions, one of the best for beginners is practice contest. Everyone can enjoy it, whether he spends money and whether it is free. The number of prizes and the number of winners are different in each contest. You can see the number of total spots, the number of Winning Spots, percentage of winners, and the number of maximum entries or teams in each contest you can join. The prize pools are different for different places winners in a contest. After finishing the match, the winner’s announcement of every contest. Dream 11 gives a chance to every player to easily join the contest and get a chance of winning the biggest.

#5Track the match.

After finishing the given up steps, it is necessary to track the player's live info. Track your player progress at different websites and apps such as cricbuzz, criclive, hotstar and many more and plenty enjoy the match. Moreover, your player fantasy points renew after every two minutes. Your fantasy points are updated a bit later than your live score.

So it is necessary to have strong patience in this game.

After finishing the match, your team results come in front of you.

Tips and Tricks to create a Dream Team in Dream 11.

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-218fbbe2e0b825485647d733c035850e)

Planning is very necessary to achieve any type of success in any career and it is necessary that you should have sufficient knowledge of planning. Similarly, if you want to achieve success or if you want to make more money in Dream 11, you should have knowledge, you should have planning. So, today I will tell you top tips and tricks (or planning tips) that will help to win more contests and more money.

#1Don’t be greedy.

As you know, this fantasy app requires a lot of patience. Here Don’t be greedy means Don’t play every match to make more money.

For example: I am a beginner and I don’t have sufficient knowledge about football. In greed of making more money, I play “match to match” one after, continue wasting money in football contests.

So at the conclusion of this point, I will say that, play only those matches which you have sufficient knowledge of.

#2 Play selective matches.

One of the biggest mistakes of beginners is that they don’t have patience. They want to play every match, they join every contest whether they have sufficient knowledge or not. Finally, the result of their greediness, is that they lose all their money. I will suggest to all that avoid joining every contest as much as possible. If you want to become successful in this fantasy sport,

#3Research before playing.

To get strong held in Dream 11, it is very important to all of us research before playing any contest. whether it is a cricket contest, whether it is a football contest or whether it is another. But research on the following topics is more important than all of these.

• Research about player’s recent performance.

• Research about the pitch condition.

• Follow the toss details.

• How teams perform at batting first and bowling first.

• How the player performs against the opposite bowlers.

• Renew your team before half hour.

#Research about player recent performance.

If you want to create your Dream Team in Dream 11 and want to win more money in this fantasy sport, Then, it is necessary to check the player's recent performance. How he performed in recent matches and also researched the ground performance of the player. How he performed in recent matches on that ground.

#Research about pitch condition.

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f4989b77c674a1b880ec33c9923e654-lq)

Before creating your Dream Team, we should have a Pitch report. How it is helpful for bowlers ( Pacers and Spinners) and how it is useful for batsmen. Find the average probability of bowlers and batsmen and create your team from the most probable players. If you do not get any reports about pitch conditions, Then I will suggest that research the ground history of recent matches. You will get it on cricbuzz easily.

#Follow the toss details.

After being tossed, everyone knows which team will bat first and which will bowl. So, pick the players according to your research.

For example: if the match is Australia vs Bangladesh. As you know, Australia is better than both ( Batting and Bowling) from Bangladesh.

1st Condition: If Australia will be bat first.

Pick Batsmen : In 1st condition, if Australia will bat first, there will be a lot of probability of having high scores towards Australian batsmen and very few chances of falling down wickets of Australia. So in these conditions we should select top order Australian batsmen.

2nd Condition : If Australia will bowl first.

If Australia will bowl first, then we should pick more bowlers from the Australian team because in this case, the batting of Bangladesh will not stop for a long time. In this case, the chance of all out of Bangladesh will be more. So in this condition we should select more bowlers from the Australian team. You can select up to seven players from one team. But how can you select four other players? In this case, it is better to select batsmen and all rounders rather than bowlers of the Bangladesh team. Because the bowlers, Bangladesh will not be successful in taking more wickets.

#Select All Rounders in your Team.

According to Dream 11 rule, you have to choose at least one rounder, and more than you can choose up to 4 All rounders. Select All Rounders in your team is one of the best keys to making a Dream Team. Because they give you points in both sections ( Bowling and Batting). Think that, If they didn’t take wicket in bowling, then he had another option of batting. Maybe they give you more points from batting. Making Captain Or Vice Captain of All rounders is also a good option.

#Select your Captain and Vice captain.

Select your Captain and Vice captain wisely by understanding pitch condition. If you choose the captain and Vice Captain, then you become a game changer. The Captain and Vice Captain play a crucial role in our team. They work as one and a half players because the Captain gives you 2x points and the Vice Captain gives you 1.5x points.

• If the pitch is helpful for bowlers, then you should select a bowler as a Captain and Vice Captain. .

• If the pitch is helpful for batsmen’s , then you should select the top order batsmen as Captain and Vice Captain.

• If the pitch is helpful for both ( Batsmens and Bowlers), then you should select all rounders as Captain and Vice Captain, because they give you points in both Batting and Bowling.

But keep in mind all rounders should bowl his full overs such as Hardik Pandya, Ben Stokes, Maxwell, Chris Morris, James Neesham, Andre Russell,. Part time all rounders are not a good option for Captain and Vice Captain.

#Renew your team 30 minutes before the match starts.

One of the biggest mistakes of players is that they make their team before playing XI squad info in which they choose the players who are not even playing in the Playing XI squad. So renew your team when the Playing XI is declared. You can check the playing XI at cricbuzz. Dream 11 also shows the playing or not playing players from the symbol of green point and red point when lineups start. Make sure all your players are playing.

#Keep patience ( Don’t be over rich).

One of the biggest mistakes of beginners is that when they win some amount of money in starting, they think that they become a successful fantasy player. They start investing all their money in single matches. If you win some amount of money, it doesn’t mean you will win in all contests. So keep patience and invest a lower amount of money in all matches. So keep patience, avoid losing all your money.

#Join low competition contests.

People want to become a millionaire one day on this fantasy platform. From this inferior thinking or Greedy thinking, they start joining mega and hot contests and losing all their money. Mega contests and hot contests are high competition contests. million people’s participate in them. So winning chances of a normal person becomes very low. If you want to win more money without losing your money. You should join low competition contests.

#Become a Risky.

As you know, every player performs differently in different matches. Either he performs well or is either bad. So, risks are also necessary, if you have a big win dream on this fantasy platform. However, Dream 11 shows no selection percentage of players. That helps you to better understanding.

Analysis and knowledge are the two key factors at the top of my list to create a team on Dream 11 that actually has the chance of winning. For cricket, specifically the IPL, you should read about the performances of the players you are going to choose. You can find detailed statistics on several websites. Try to create a balanced team with the right number of batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders. I have always preferred more all rounders as you never know when they might end up taking a lot of wickets or scoring a lot of runs. This strategy always allows most of my teams to finish in the top 50,0

Try to create a balanced team with the right number of batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders. I have always preferred more all rounders as you never know when they might end up taking a lot of wickets or scoring a lot of runs. This strategy always allows most of my teams to finish in the top 50,000 teams, the closest I have come is rank 289. It’s essential that you participate with multiple teams as this increases the odds of you winning, I understand it costs more but if you really want to win big then you’ll have to bear the risk associated with it. If you’re a beginner then start with small contests with a low number of participants (ideally 10-15) so that you can test your skills. Once you start acing these contests, continue to take part in contests with more participants. This strategy has worked for me and you will make money. I can suggest you a similar app where the buy-in amount is just Rs.10, it’s called KhelRaja. Khelraja is an online live-casino and sports betting platform which offers tournaments for games like Teen Patti, Poker and others. The casino gives players an experience similar to real-life as they have real-time dealers and a user interface. One of its biggest USPs is that deposits and withdrawals can be done via UPI. I would highly suggest this application if you’re a card person and want to make some money. I hope this answers your question, play wisely.

You can create a Dream 11 winning Team for cricket matches with the help of these things:

(1) Play only those matches where you have good knowledge about All Players.

(2) Initially invest very less and create regular teams and analysis your mistakes after the match so that you can improve for next match.

(3) Always focus on learning, you can learn with watch live match or you can learn it through watching fantasy preview from Fantasy Prediction For Free YouTube Channel.

2. Research the players and teams: It is important to do your research and stay updated on the latest news and updates about the players and teams you are considering for your Dream11 team. Look at player statistics, recent performances, injuries, and other factors that may affect their performance.
3. Choose players who are likely to play: Make sure to select players who are confirmed to be playing in the match. Avoid selecting players who are doubtful or injured as they may not play or may not perform well.
4. Select players based on their roles: Each player has a different role in their team, and it is important to select players who are likely to play a significant role in the match. For example, in cricket, selecting a top-order batsman who is likely to bat for a longer period may be more valuable than a lower-order batsman who may only get a few balls to face.
5. Consider the pitch and conditions: The pitch and weather conditions can play a significant role in determining the outcome of a match. Consider these factors when selecting players for your team, as some players may perform better in certain conditions.
6. Balance your team: It is important to balance your team and select players from different positions and teams. Avoid selecting too many players from one team as this may put your team at risk if that team performs poorly.

By following these tips, you can increase your chances of creating a good Dream11 team and winning your fantasy sports league.

Remember these while selecting the players- -If the pitch is appropriate enough for the batsman, choose 2 players out of the top 3 -Choose all-rounders predominantly. -The user must pick at least 1 death bowler. However, I feel that fantasy sports require endless efforts in terms of researching, analyzing, and choosing the players. Most often, I like playing games that are hassle-free, to begin with. Thus, I prefer playing online casino games and sometimes I do engage in sports betting too. I use Khelraja for all my betting and casino gaming needs.

First start joining free contest ,if you are new to dream 11.

Then Start with small league and head to head match. After all go for mega contest.

It is advisable to make a team of 6 player from one team and 5 player from other team .

Before creating a team or joining any contest read about pitch and weather report so that you can get knowledge ,whether you should choose captain to a bowler or batsman .

Batting pitch having more runs on scoreboard ,captain and vice should be batsman who can score at least minimum 50 .

Make sure you play with 3 key all-rounder so that they can score runs or take wickets.

The best and proved way to make dream 11 winning team is to keep an eye on the recent form of the players, players battle which means which bowler is effective for the against team, the most important thing to be kept in mind is pitch report that comes before the match as it provides you the idea of the pitch whether you should pick more batters in your team or it is bowler who is going to give you points in this match.

You have to develop your own tricks and strategies. There is no hacks or hidden way. It's just your strategy, study and bit of luck.

You could follow some tips

1. Prepare team which is not common. Usually the team players selected by all end sharing price. Create a team which would be uncommon.
2. Pick a unusual captain. This is a bit risky. Pick a captian which is good player but has not performed. He might play the upcoming game to prove his point. Or pick a player as captian who is making a return to team.
3. Pick bowlers over batsmen for captain/VC. Bowler earn more point when they take wickets.

In cricket there is 3 form

1-Test

2-ODI

3-T20

Test- Its the oldest format and longest format of cricket, to win a test match u need to pick 10wickets in each of the innings so here it is preety ovious that u need bowlers .

As it consists of 90 over per day u need to have really good a on an around 4–5 bowlers to bowl the quota of 90 overs/day.

So basically teams prefers to go with 5 bowlers or 4bowlers+1allrounders in test matches.

So overall combination depending upon the conditions of the pitch and climate players are picked an ideal team consist of 5 proper batsman 1wicket-keeper & 5 proper bowler

So overall combination depending upon the conditions of the pitch and climate players are picked an ideal team consist of 5 proper batsman 1wicket-keeper & 5 proper bowlers. U may pick 1 all-rounder in place of a bowler that must be a bowling-allrounder.

ODI- This format is of 50overs

And played in one day

So basically here team combinations are like 5batsman 1WK and 1allrounder (batting allrounder) & 4bowlers.

Now T20- This the fastest and cherismatic format of cricket here it consists of 20 overs.

So basically people come to see 4s&6s entertainment rather then boring out’s of batsman so teams prefer hera a wicket keeper with good batting abllity 5 proper batsman and 2allrounders and 3proper bowlers !!

The above combinations are mine own , it may defer to other people.

Suggestions and correction are welcome cheers \\U0001f60b

1st step:make sure your selected members should be in 11 for this check about probable team mates through their official Twitter pages and other sources

2nd step:captain and vice captain plays a crucial role in match so keep them carefully

3rd step:use this trick like create two different teams and keep different captain and vice captain and join in any league with three members for example if you join in 115 league with two different teams there is 95% chances to win one of the team if you win one of two leagues you still get a profit of 70

FOR 115 PRIZE IS 300

winning one league 300 means you get 70 but make sure create those two teams carefully like to win any one of them

if you join with 2300 u get a profit of 700 yes it is little bit of risky but there is more chances to win than a regular play

It depends on game, format and more factors. However you can focus on the following:

- Do not fall for old points
- Keep 8(players with good selection percentage):3(low selection percentage) ratio
- Choose C and VC who are confirmed to get chance to perform-like opening batsman, opening bowlers
- For cricket, you can check pitch reports and old records but analysis of the present condition is necessary.
- For playing with multiple teams- plan in advance do not wait for lineups

For those who don't know, Dream 11 is an online fantasy gaming app where you can use money to participate in tournaments based on real sports leagues like the IPL, La Liga, Premier League and other popular leagues. You pick a match and select your own custom team. Now coming to the question, the optimal way of maximising your profits is through analysis, risk and awareness. You need to look at performance stats and make your call. Most people create teams randomly so you'll be at an advantage. Follow the news and trends about the players' injuries, venue and other factors because they do result in how many points your team will make. Choose your captain and vice-captain wisely, as the captain gets 2x points and the VC gets 1.5x. To reduce the risk, create and participate with multiple teams which will increase your odds and use a variety of combinations that are best suited. You'll need to put in extra effort to get ahead and you'll see results. If this not your cup of tea then I suggest you look for alternative gaming platforms like KhelRaja. KhelRaja is an online sports betting and live casino application that pays cash rewards and prizes for participating in various sports like tennis, horse racing, etc. They have slot machines with integrated real time dealers in their casinos, which almost makes the experience real. Huge array of games like poker, teen patti, rummy, etc. Check it out if cards are your forte. I hope this helps answer your question.

If you are going to choose 11 from 22 players, its very hard that you make team of best 11, and also you need to add captain and vise captain, so please play for entertainment and fun, don’t take dream 11 as gambling.

Good dream 11 team means you need to predict, who is performing well in this match.

So how we can find the player who will play well?

answer is very simple you need to find back performance data and match up form both team, with this you need to add your exprice about your knowledge and your prediction skills also.

It differs from match to match and depends on conditions. The teams that are playing and their strengths and weaknesses and in form players.

First thing is know the points given for different formats for every run scored and wicket taken.

Then if you can read the game and analyse it and make a calculated educated guess into how it might turn out can be hugely helpful. For ex if the wicket is spicy you know it won't be a high scoring game and that ball with dominate bat. Opposite for a placid wicket. This is just the surface of it.

Then don't pick emotionally. Be objective. That is don't just select your favorite players or well known popular players. Others are in their teams respectively because they too are deserving and can perform too.

Keeping in mind all these clichéd but important points make your team. You can make more than one and upto 6 teams so you can make it with little tweaks in combinations or just with players whom you select to be Captain and Vice Captain.

And do not get sucked in by bias as in you may think or it may be a popular opinion that a particular bowler leaks runs on higher side and then another who is a safe bowler and bowls miserly. The fantasy game does not reward you for economy rates though there is bonus point involved for that, but it rather allocates more points for wickets taken. So choose wisely.

Lastly all things said and done, you do need LUCK on your side.

A good team is made of good players. You must have good knowledge about the game and pitch also. Select only the best players for the team who gives the best input for the game. You must daily track players' performance and choose the best player as a caption and vice caption of the team. Always make a balance for the team with the right number of bowlers, batsmen, fielding, etc.

I use OR gate and probability to predict best possible outcomes for Dream team its working well for me. Deciding playing 11 captain and vice captain is one thing but it is also important to chose right leagues to play. I am a data analysis enthusiast and use historical data to predict best team, give playing conditions.

Its all about doing you research and when I say research it includes everything, players, their recent performance, their skill set even detailed things like weather condition pitch report etc. You are predicting here so your research needs to be dynamic to create the best team
